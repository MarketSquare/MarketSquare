FAQ for MarketSquare
====================
:Q:  Why "MarketSquare"? What does "Torilla Tavataan" mean?
:A:  Torilla Tavataan means "Let's meet at the Market Square!". This is a Finnish saying that is used when either something great happens to Finland, like Finland's qualification for the European Football Championships, or if some mention of Finland makes it to the world stage. It is a celebration and a point of civic pride. In thinking about a name for a place where we gather together and share Robot Framework code it seemed fitting to call it MarketSquare.
